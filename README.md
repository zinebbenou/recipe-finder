# Getting Started with Your React Application

This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts You Can Run

Within the project folder, the following commands are available:

### `npm start`

This command launches the application in development mode. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to see it in action.

The page will refresh automatically upon any changes, and any linting errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

This command runs the test suite in interactive watch mode. For further details, refer to the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

This command creates an optimized build of your application in the `build` folder, suitable for production deployment. It compiles React for production and optimizes performance.

The output is minified, and file names will include hashes to ensure proper caching. Your app is now ready for deployment!

Refer to the deployment guide for additional instructions: [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Warning: This action is irreversible! Once you `eject`, reverting is not possible.**

If you're looking to modify the default configurations, you can use this command to extract all build dependencies. It will copy all configuration files and dependencies like webpack, Babel, and ESLint directly into your project, giving you complete control.

Post-eject, all commands except `eject` will continue to function, but they will point to your newly copied scripts. Be cautious; you donâ€™t have to `eject` unless absolutely necessary. The default curated feature set is adequate for most small to medium-sized applications.
